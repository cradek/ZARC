Copied from an earlier project:

Schematics are in gEDA. Use:

gschem Z80_1.sch - schematic editor
refdes_renum [--force] flash_*.sch - renumber
gnetlist -g bom2 -o output.bom flash_*.sch - generate parts list
gattrib flash_*.sch - edit attributes en masse.
gsymcheck -vv [symbol] - checks a symbol

ps_to_png.sh converts PostScript files to .png, which provides much nicer output than the built-in .png production.

grep "<string>" *.sch - Find something in the design

System libraries are stored at /usr/share/gEDA/sym/

Use "gattrib" to alter design attributes in bulk (schematics only).

To print schematics, just File / Print. Set sheet size to A4. If "lpr: Error - no default destination available" run "lpstat -p -d" to show printers, and set default with "lpoptions -d  HP_LaserJet_M14-M17", for example.

"Found a cpinlist head with a netname!" error are due to "net=RAM_VCC:<x>" attributes. It seems the error can be safely ignored.

Converting to "Lepton", which is a fork of geda that is currently maintained.

lepton-schematic - schematic editor
