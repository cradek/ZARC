# ZARC Hardware
Most people interested in the hardware will want to have a look at the schematics.

* Main board - [Schematics.pdf](hardware/CAD/Main/Output/Schematics.pdf)
* Front panel - [Schematics.pdf](hardware/CAD/Panel/Output/Schematics.pdf)
* I/O board - [Schematics.pdf](hardware/CAD/IO/Output/Schematics.pdf)

The schematics were drawn in [Lepton](https://github.com/lepton-eda/lepton-eda), which is a fork of geda. The boards are wired to the wiring lists generated by the CAD system. There is no corresponding PCB artwork.
