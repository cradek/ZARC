# ZX81 Emulator for ZARC

This emulator is written specifically for my ZARC retro-computer project. It runs under CP/M 2.2. The terminal-based nature of ZARC's display does force certain limitations, but BASIC or other programmes that do not access the display file directly should work. "LOAD" and "SAVE" are implemented, with data sent to named disk files instead of cassette tape as on the original system. The "Greedy Gulch" adventure runs nicely without any modifications, for example. See my blog post: [https://www.tech-cave.co.uk/2022/08/greedy-gulch.html](https://www.tech-cave.co.uk/2022/08/greedy-gulch.html).

Since ZARC-specific features are used, this emulator can only run on a ZARC system.
