# ZARC Z80 Computer CP/M Utilities
ZARC is a tool specifically for my ZARC retro-computer project. It enables access to some ZARC-specific features. At present, the only options implemented are:

* HELP - list options
* EXIT - exit CP/M and return to monitor

Although [ZARC.COM](zarc/ZARC.COM) should run on other CP/M systems, it is unlikely to be useful. It will report "ZARC BIOS not detected" and return to CP/M.

I may extend this utility in future to allow access to the real time clock, for example.
