# Bitcoin Mining on CP/M
Clearly what the world needs is a way of mining Bitcoin on vintage CP/M 2.2 systems! Though written for my ZARC retro-computer project, this should run on any suitable CP/M system. For further information, see [BitcoinGuide.pdf](bitcoin/BitcoinGuide.pdf).

This is in no way a useful way to mine Bitcoin, but should be considered more of a working model in the manner of a table-top model steam engine. It was inspired by Ken Shirriff's posts such as [http://www.righto.com/2014/09/mining-bitcoin-with-pencil-and-paper.html](http://www.righto.com/2014/09/mining-bitcoin-with-pencil-and-paper.html).
