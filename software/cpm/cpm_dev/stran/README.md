# Serial File Transfer for CP/M ("stran")
This programme is intended to run under CP/M 2.2. It communicates with a Python programme running on a Linux (or potentially Windows) system to transfer files between the two environments. This code (the CP/M end) functions as a server, responding to commands from the Linux end. There are other programs that perform similar tasks, such as kermit. Unfortunately, these turn out to be somewhat cumbersome to use, with several commands required for each file transferred. Unlike at least some of the alternative programs, stran is capable of transferring data on either the console or another serial line. BIOS functions are used for serial I/O, which should make this portable. To install the CP/M side of things, simply copy [STRAN.COM](stran/STRAN.COM) to a disk and run it. For further information, see [STranGuide.pdf](../../tools/stran/STranGuide.pdf). The Linux side is available at [ZARC/software/tools/stran/](../../tools/stran).

## Further Development
Currently, only transfers from Linux to CP/M are possible. If the need arises, I plan to implement transfers in the opposite direction. The protocol has been designed with this in mind.
