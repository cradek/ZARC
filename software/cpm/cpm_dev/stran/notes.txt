stran can be used to download a new version of itself. The script stran.sh does this, but it is wise to copy the current version first.

A> ren stranold.com=stran.com
A> stranold

The new file is downloaded by stran.sh as STRAN.COM, but of course STRANOLD.COM is there if it all goes horribly wrong.
