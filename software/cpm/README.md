# CP/M Software
This folder contains the software related to running CP/M 2.2 on my ZARC retro-computer project.

* [bios](cpm/bios) - the customised BIOS required to run CP/M 2.2 on ZARC.
* [cpm_dev](cpm/cpm_dev) - applications developed for this environment. Some are specific to ZARC, but others may be run on any suitable CP/M system.
* [img_to_files](cpm/img_to_files) - a tool to extract files from CP/M disk images available on the internet.

For further information about CP/M running on ZARC, see [ZARC CP/M Users' Guide](cpm/CPM_Guide.pdf).
