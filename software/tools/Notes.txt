Assembler and linker: http://48k.ca/zmac.html and http://48k.ca/ld80.html
Ultimately C: http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/ ?

ld80 is a clone of Micro$oft's LINK-80, a manual for which may be found here: http://altairclone.com/downloads/manuals/Microsoft%20L80%20Linker.pdf

Useful example project: https://github.com/SuperFabius/Z80-MBC
Intel hex loader: https://github.com/SuperFabius/Z80-MBC/blob/master/S260117%20iLoad.asm

Added path to file ~.profile (later replaced by scripts - see 18/4/2021):

# Added by Merlin on 14/5/2020
PATH="$HOME/Technical/HardwareProjects/ZARC_Z80_Box/Software/tools/zmac:$PATH"
PATH="$HOME/Technical/HardwareProjects/ZARC_Z80_Box/Software/tools/ld80:$PATH"

Using gedit as a source editor. I used the Z80 syntax highlighting file from:

https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/436/43646.html

A copy of the (modified) syntax file is in this folder (z80.lang).

This must be copied to either:

/usr/share/gtksourceview-4/language-specs/ (for system-wide use) or

~/.local/share/gtksourceview-4/language-specs/ (for use by current user only).

I went for the second option as it avoids mucking about with sudo and the system.

Note - updated on 3/6/2021
mkdir ~/.local/share/gtksourceview-4/language-specs/
cp z80.lang ~/.local/share/gtksourceview-4/language-specs/

Make white space visible:
sudo apt-get install gedit-plugins
Preferences / Plugins / Draw Spaces

Set tabs:
Preferences / Editor / Tab width: 4
Select Insert spaces instead of tabs.

There is a useful decoder for "Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions" here:

Considering https://www.z88dk.org/

https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk/wiki/installation

Looking at instructions at https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk/wiki/installation

It requires a long list of packages to be installed:

dos2unix
libboost-all-dev
texinfo
texi2html
libxml2-dev
subversion
bison
flex
zlib1g-dev

I'm not keen. Back to zmac and ld80.

Updating zmac from "05jan19" to "25aug2020". It might solve the odd corrupt listing file error I receive. Procedure:

Download from http://48k.ca/zmac.html

make

If it complains that yacc is missing: sudo apt install flex bison

It doesn't fix the listing issue. It does, however, add the use of instructions as immediate values. This is handy in a few places in the monitor.


27/12/2020 (Sunday)

Adding a "scripts" folder to ~/.profile so project scripts are available in all folders. SEE NOTES OF 18/4/2021!

# Added by Merlin on 14/5/2020 (modified 27/12/2020)
PATH="$HOME/Technical/HardwareProjects/ZARC_Z80_Box/Software/tools/zmac:$PATH"
PATH="$HOME/Technical/HardwareProjects/ZARC_Z80_Box/Software/tools/ld80:$PATH"
PATH="$HOME/Technical/HardwareProjects/ZARC_Z80_Box/Software/tools/scripts:$PATH"


18/4/2021 (Sunday)

Cumbersome PATH variable modifications replaced by putting scripts in /usr/local/bin
It was getting out of hand, with utilities such as the assembler and stran all having separate directories. Scripts installed using:

sudo cp * /usr/local/bin
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/*

from the scripts folder.


21/4/2021 (Wednesday)

Some scripts modified and renamed to implement a second USB serial adaptor on ZARC ser2. Now we have:

zmac
ld80
stran
zarc_dl <file> <port>
zarc_term <port>


22/4/2022 (Friday)

After reinstall (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS), I needed to:

sudo apt install make
sudo apt install minicom
Copy scripts as described above (18/4/2021).
sudo adduser $USER dialout
Log out and back in again.
gedit customisations (see notes of 6/9/2019 above)


25/5/2022 (Wednesday)

Modified library location to use an environment variable.

Added to ~/.bashrc:

# Added by Merlin on 25/6/2022 for ZARC Z80 include files
export ZARC_INCLUDE="/home/merlin/Technical/HardwareProjects/ZARC_Z80_Box/software/includes/"
